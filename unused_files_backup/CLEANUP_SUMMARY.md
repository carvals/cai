# Unused Files Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-09-22

## Files Removed:
1. `CAI_design_1_chat/Presentation/FileUploadPage.xaml` (18,726 bytes)
2. `CAI_design_1_chat/Presentation/FileUploadPage.xaml.cs` (18,739 bytes)
3. `CAI_design_1_chat/Presentation/EnhancedFileUploadDialog.xaml` (10,806 bytes)
4. `CAI_design_1_chat/Presentation/EnhancedFileUploadDialog.xaml.cs` (15,148 bytes)

## Reason for Removal:
These files were legacy components that were replaced by the FileUploadOverlay system integrated directly into MainPage.xaml. The application now uses:
- `MainPage.xaml` - Contains FileUploadOverlay for file processing
- `MainPage.xaml.cs` - Contains all file upload logic and event handlers

## Verification:
- ✅ No references found in codebase
- ✅ Not included in project file
- ✅ Build successful after removal
- ✅ Application functionality preserved
- ✅ Files backed up in unused_files_backup/ directory

## Benefits:
- Eliminates confusion about which file upload component is active
- Reduces codebase size by ~63KB
- Simplifies maintenance and debugging
- Prevents future developers from accidentally editing unused files

## Recovery:
If these files are needed in the future, they are backed up in the unused_files_backup/ directory.
